I am a passionate AI/ML Engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a deep interest in the latest advancements in artificial intelligence. My professional journey has been driven by a curiosity to solve complex problems through data-driven insights and innovative algorithms.

**Experience**

*   **Associate AI/ML Engineer**
    *   **Company**: Motadata (MindArray Systems Pvt. Ltd.)
    *   **Dates**: Jun 2025 - Present · 2 mos
    *   **Location**: Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India
    *   **Description**: (Note: The subagent extracted the intern role description in detail, but the current role "Associate AI/ML Engineer" was listed in the headline and timeline. Assuming the description is similar or it's a continuation.)

*   **AI/ML Engineer Intern (R&D)**
    *   **Company**: Motadata
    *   **Dates**: Aug 2024 - May 2025 · 10 mos
    *   **Description**: Working as an AI-ML Engineer in R&D team of PMG Department. Focused on developing leading LLM Platform for interacting with DB and generating relevant answacers in sub-seconds within the call initiation.
    The task involves in making the Motadata ServiceOps ITSM Portal AI enabled where clients can interact with the product through LLM based ChatBot. Pertaining to the task, we're enhancing NL2SQL accuracy while optimizing time and cost, providing a lead than the competitors.

*   **Data Science Intern (R&D)**
    *   **Company**: Trionic Technologies LLP
    *   **Dates**: May 2024 - Jun 2024 · 2 mos
    *   **Location**: Remote
    *   **Description**: During my summer Internship in Trionic Technologies LLP, I worked as AI/ML and Data Science Intern and was actively working on excelling my ML skills where I got the time to refresh my knowledge about different Machine Algorithms, while gaining experience in TensorFlow, LangChain and Ollama Models.
    The prime task that I was involved in was to localization of LLM model and repurpose it for specific use-case of question generation. During this time,I learnt how to localize the model locally into a PC and set up the model to run on a server as and when required. For this project, I use HuggingFace model space to explore models and pretained using Mistral 7b v0.3 Instruct model and hosted it GGUF counterpart using Ollama and LMStudio. Then I containerzed the model using Docker and enabled it to run locally on Windows OS, Linux, Docker Environment and WSL. This internship gave me the opportunity to work on cutting edge technology and advance my career into LLMs.

*   **Forage Virtual Intern**
    *   **Company**: Forage
    *   **Dates**: May 2023 - Jun 2023 · 2 mos
    *   **Location**: Online · Remote
    *   **Description**: Within the span of 2 months, I completed 7 micro-internships on Forage from different companies and domains. This included API Development (VISA), Solutions Architecture (AWS), Cyber Security (Goldman Sachs), Dash Automation (Quantium), Data Analysis and Coding (Deloitte), Data Science (British Airways) and Software Development Infrastructure (Accenture).
    These crucial internships helped me explore multi-faceted developer portfolios and helped me understand intricacies and workings of different domains. During this internship, I developed a new-found interest in Data Science and Machine Learning for predicting and analysis of different kinds of data. I was also able to gain important skills regarding to Cloud, Cyber-security and API-development.
